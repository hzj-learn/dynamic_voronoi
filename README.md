# dynamicvoronoi
comment and understand for Dynamic Voronoi Graph generation and updating method

This project's code is cloned from [Dynamic Voronoi](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~lau/dynamicvoronoi/) at master branch. My comments and understand are added at develop branch. However, there is a little unimportant change in code. For convenience the comments are in Chinese. If you have any problem or idea, don't hesitate to tell me.

The most important, 3 papers listed in [Dynamic Voronoi](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~lau/dynamicvoronoi/) is strongly recommended to read.
